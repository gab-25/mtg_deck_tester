"""Plays a stored match on the Forge bridge and stores what happened.

:func:`start_game` sends the seats' decklists to the bridge, which refuses a
deck with a card Forge does not know (:class:`~.forge.ForgeDeckError`) before
any game starts; the new-playtest view calls it, so a refused match is never
created. :func:`run_match`, the background job, then copies the bridge's
events into ``MatchEvent`` rows as they arrive and, when the game is over,
stores the winner, the end reason and the summary.

Decisions are answered by the worker pool (:mod:`.workers`). When no pool runs
in this process (a web process, ``FORGE_WORKERS=0``, and tests) the runner answers its own
match's decisions in between reading the log.
