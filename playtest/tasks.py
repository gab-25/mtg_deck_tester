"""The Celery side of a playtest: the match task and the worker's lifecycle.

:func:`run_match_task` follows one match's game (:func:`.runner.run_match`).
The worker also runs the decision pool (:mod:`.workers`): it starts once, when
the worker is ready, which then re-queues every match the database still calls
pending or running — a restart never leaves one behind, even if the broker lost
its queue. There is a single worker process (``--pool threads``), so the pool
size bounds the Jev calls in flight and :data:`_following` is enough to drop a
duplicate delivery.
